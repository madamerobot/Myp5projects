<h1>Introduction:</h1>
<p>The reason why I started my coding journey is called p5. p5 is a open-source JS library, which started with the original goal to make coding accessibe for artists, designers, educators and beginners.<br>

Using the original metaphor of a software sketchbook, p5 has a full set of drawing functionality (such as creating shapes and frame-rate based animations). You can find more information at https://p5js.org/.

<h1>About:</h1>
<p>This repository features some of my p5 sketches. They are ranging from small-scope effor (e.g. 'wool') to bigger scope effort (e.g. luncherizer') and have been created in my spare time for fun.<br>
